imptri: the Implicit surface triangulator, is a protocol tools that can generate polygons from implicit surfaces.
Plan:
	3D & 2D implicit surface polygonization
	Focus on the geometric quality of simplex
		Polygons are composed by well shape triangles(in 3D) or line segments(in 2D)
		Not based on cubic marching method
